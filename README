Hello there

this is a small collection of python classes that can calculate
among others thing the reference evaportranspiration according the corrected
penman-monteith method.

This is a utility I wrote in my spare time and as such it is mostly undocumented
and possibly contains bugs.
It used to have a graphical user interface based on wxPython toolkit, but it proved
to be backwards-inconsistent and increased the requirements of the program
so I chose to discard that and use a console based one.

After all the main purpose of this small project is to create the classes not so much
to create a full fledged program.

In the doc directory I have placed the relative paper the fao has produced describing the 
penman-monteith method so if you have any doubts about the results you can double-check them
on your own.


For now thats all
