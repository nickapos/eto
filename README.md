Hello everyone

This is a small collection of python classes that can calculate among others thing the reference evaportranspiration according to the corrected penman-monteith method.

This is a utility I wrote in my spare time and as such it is mostly undocumented and possibly contains bugs. It used to have a graphical user interface based on wxPython toolkit, but it proved to be backwards-inconsistent and increased the requirements of the program so I chose to discard that and use a console based one.

After all the main purpose of this small project is to create the classes not so much to create a full fledged program.

In the doc directory I have placed the relative paper the fao has produced describing the penman-monteith method so if you have any doubts about the results you can double-check them on your own.

This directory contains two independent impementations of the same algorithm. One is written in python and the other one in ocaml.
Each implementation is completely independent. The stable implementation is the one in python. The ocaml implementation is under development
and probably contains bugs.

Thank you for your interest in eto
